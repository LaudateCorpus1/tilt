#Tilt Game

A puzzle game for web and iOS

Demo: http://www.andreashackel.de/tilt

Tilt is a new puzzle game created with HTML5 and javascript which had been wrapped with PhoneGap into a iOS app. I released Tilt in 2013 on the iOS Store but I now decided to make it open source. Since Tilt is a basically a webpage it should run on any modern browser and also on iOS devices. I did not check it on Android, but it should also run there.

Please let me know if you like Tilt or if you have any questions about it :)
